## Project's current progress

We are significantly behind in our project goals. Testing and design doc are significant issues for our team
as well as overall universal vision for the project.

## Current level of communication

We have met in person as a team twice this sprint. We definitely need to do better about budgeting smaller
segments of time so that others can work simultaneously and not get slowed down by others' lack of 
project completion.

## Satisfaction with team roles

Team roles have been loosely defined but we need to strength partner programming expectations and scrum
style communication that occurs daily.

## Teamwork that worked well

* Thing #1

Dividing responsibility into partners worked well for easy communication.

* Thing #2

Planning as a team was good this week but we need to spend more time focused in times when we meet in person.

## Teamwork that could be improved

* Thing #1

Over the weekend, communication was poor and inconsistent. We need to be better about being consistently
working throughout the week.

* Thing #2

Maintaining better branch management. Making sure to delete
branches that are no longer being used is a priority.
