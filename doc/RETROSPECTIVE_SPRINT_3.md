## Project's current progress

We feel significantly behind this week and need to catch up in order to put forth a satisfying product.
The plan is to put over 20 hours per person during the final sprint in order to make up for lost time refactoring
in the previous two sprints.

## Current level of communication

We are communicating very well as this point of the project. Frequent meetings happen both in person and 
online every couple days. We have solidified a builder, player, and social focus team that work internally
on their specific component of the design.

## Satisfaction with team roles

Team roles have improved and been further solidified during this sprint.

## Teamwork that worked well

* Thing #1

Greater urgency this sprint has helped to motivate participation. In particular accountability between
internal groups has improved overall teamwork.

* Thing #2

Planning at the start of the sprint has been a lot more concrete, due to how far along in the project we
are git issues are far more specific and require less communciation.

## Teamwork that could be improved

* Thing #1

We have been struggling with disparity in time spent on the project between team members.

* Thing #2

Branch management and issue usage, specifically deleting old branches continues to be a struggle.
