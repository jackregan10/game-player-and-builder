## Project's current progress

The project is in a good spot, much better than where it was in sprint 2. We have made a lot of
progress in the correct direction and the team has been able to come together. We are mainly
needing to flesh out the social hub, polish the builder, create new games.

## Current level of communication

Going well, active chat. Disparity in communication levels among teammates, some communicate 
frequently while some may communicate less.

## Satisfaction with team roles

Team roles seem to be fleshed out, people are content in their roles for the most part
and the roles are dynamic in that most group members can help with multiple parts of the
project at will.

## Teamwork that worked well

### Thing #1

- Have had multiple group meetings to pair program and be on the same page.
- Impromptu meetings with high attendance to discuss high priority issues.
- Sending daily messages updating on progress for the day

### Thing #2

- Frequently update the chat when there are major changes made
- Attempting to reach code uniformity.
- Group effort to test.
- Cleaning pipeline before pushing feature branch


## Teamwork that could be improved

* Thing #1

- Workload disparity (number of hours committed per person)
- Clarity on what people are working on
- Better usage of git issues

* Thing #2

- Ensuring that everything is pushed
- Testing before pushing

## Teamwork to improve next Sprint

The team can improve on more clearly assigning issues and in turn will see 
higher output and more equal distribution of hours.
