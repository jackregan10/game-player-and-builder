### Starting Files
The project started with a simple Maven file structure and Main class.

### Handleable Errors

 * Invalid profile login and signup
 * Missing resources are loaded as a placeholder
 * Badly formatted Jsons show pop-ups and allow fixing in builder
 * Show pop-up for Jsons that break Json syntax

### Running the Program

* Main class:

* Data files needed:
    * Properties files 
    * All files needed to play games are generated by the builder when saving

* Interesting data files:

* Key/Mouse inputs:
    * The main interface is purely mouse clicks to navigate
    * The builder has drop-down menus and open text fields
    * Game controls are entirely customizable from the builder
        * Key and Mouse behaviors

### Notes/Assumptions

* Assumptions or Simplifications:
    * We assume people will only interact with Jsons through the Builder
    * We assume you must be logged in to play 
        * No guest profile

* Known Bugs:

* Features implemented:
    * Social Hub
        * Viewing other profiles
        * Playing others games
        * Building levels based off of others games
    * Profiles
        * Save and share games
    * Game Player
    * Game Builder
        * Adding game objects
        * Creating game objects with various components and behaviors
        * Saving Prefabs to be easily reused
        * Creating multiple scenes per game
    * Saving and packaging games in folders
        * Json and images stored together

* Features unimplemented:
    * Can't run multiple games
    * Themes reset when reloading program instead of saving
    * Can't save game in progress to continue later

* Noteworthy Features:

 * The builder is extremelly flexible with the ability to add custom behaviors, animations, and components to objects.
 * The social hub allows a community to grow within the program with
    * follower/following
    * Leaderboards
    * Playing others' games
    * Building games based off others' games
 * Infinite games can be made with clever use of behaviors and spawn object actions


### Assignment Impressions

The project was a great learning experience. Working in large teams was invaluable to pushing us to learn how to divide up work into many small non-dependent chunks. We also learned the value of Git Issues and frequent team meetings throughout the project. The project itself was very fun to work on and offered several good design issues that the team had to work through together. The weekly presentations were invaluable for practicing demos, keeping the team on track, and allowing us to take inspiration from the other groups. It is regrettable that the sprint 3 presentation was cancelled.
